<h3>How to play :</h3> 

- There's an empty slot, so you can move a block by dragging it.
- Simply click on a block and it will take the place of the empty slot.
- The blocks are first shuffled, and the game is won when the initial layout is reached.
- There are several levels, and to access them, you must pass the current level!
- At the start, the level is in its final position; to start it, click on the button at bottom right and select your mix type.
Then solve the riddle!
- If you get stuck, you can always click on the light bulb, which will solve the puzzle step by step. There's automatic solving, 
or square by square.
- But be careful!!! The light bulb will not validate the level.
- If the level is finished, the game board will turn green. To restart the level, press the Shuffle button again.
- Black squares are forbidden: you can't go on them.
- You can play with your mouse or keyboard: simply select the square with the arrow keys, then press space or enter.
